ðŸš€ Future Intern Internship Task 02 â€“ Stock Price Prediction

Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jacksoncrow/stock-market-dataset

Just completed another exciting project as part of my internship â€” this time, diving into the world of financial forecasting ðŸ“‰

ðŸ”Ž In this project, I used ARIMA modeling to predict the future stock prices of NVIDIA (NVDA) based on historical data. The goal was to analyze closing price trends, remove seasonality, and build a reliable forecasting model.

ðŸ§  What I learned:

How to detect trends and stationarity in time series data

The process of eliminating noise and seasonality using decomposition

Tuning ARIMA models with auto_arima to get optimal parameters

Evaluating model performance with MAPE, RMSE, and more

ðŸ“ˆ Model Accuracy:
Achieved a MAPE of 4.18%, meaning the model is ~95.82% accurate at predicting future values!
